The output is given in {\ttfamily J\+S\+ON} format. It contains some records for each adapter and route. The pos field shows the relative position regarding to the internet. We assume that public internet has \textquotesingle{}pos=0\textquotesingle{}, the physical adapter has {\ttfamily pos=1}, and the virtual adapter (vpn) has {\ttfamily pos=2}. The following is a sample output.
